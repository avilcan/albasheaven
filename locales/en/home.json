  "welcome": "Welcome to \"Alba's Heaven by Marijke Klein\"",
  "mission": "We're here to give dogs from Romania a chance to a better life",
  "missionFull": "My name is Marijke Klein and I have been committed to the Romanian stray dogs for years. They are often taken from the killing station but also found or taken on the street by Romanians who also care about animals. The dogs come to my shelter or to private individuals. My shelter Alba’s Heaven consists of 10 acres of fenced-in land where the dogs eat, drink, receive the necessary medical care and are safe. During that period my volunteers and I ensure that they are advertised on Marktplaats, Facebook and on the website with beautiful photos and videos. As soon as a dog has been booked or can go to a foster family in the Netherlands and has been fully vaccinated, he / she can take the next transport to the Netherlands. The dogs are transported with special animal transport. The great thing about a reception family is that they can get used to a homely environment, the “luxury” of the Netherlands or Belgium, and get used to it. In this way we also see what their characters are and it is easier to be able to tell interested parties whether the dog will fit into their family situation. It is wonderful for me and for the rescue workers to see that they are finally getting the love that they have so missed in the killingstation or on the street. The best part is that you slowly see the fearful and suspicious look in their eyes change to a warm, loving and grateful look. All dogs over 6 months of age are neutered or neutered. All dogs are fully microchipped, vaccinated, de-wormed before transport, receive the legally required worm pill, flea pipette and kennel cough vaccination for transport and have a European passport and health record."
