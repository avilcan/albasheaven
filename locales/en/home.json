  "mission": "We're here to give dogs from Romania a chance to a better life",
  "missionFull": "My name is Marijke Klein and I am committed to the Romanian stray dogs. They are usually saved from the euthanasia units but also picked up from the street and taken to our center where they are prepared for travel. During that time I make sure that they receive an advertisement with beautiful photos and if they receive a reservation or a reception family, they can take the next transport to the Netherlands. The beauty of a reception family is that they can get used to a domestic circumstance and learn rules in advance. In this way we also see what their characters are and it is easier to tell interested parties whether the dog will fit into their family situation. All dogs over 10 months old have been neutered or spayed, chipped, vaccinated and have a European passport."
